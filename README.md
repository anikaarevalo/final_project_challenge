# üëçfinal_project_challenge
*An individual project culminating my experience in the AI Ops training at BeCode (Ghent)*


## Description ##


## The App ##
This is a **handy yet effective software that analyses customer product reviews on the web in order to gauge over-all consumer satisfaction**. At this stage of the product cycle development, it is a proof of concept for clients who are open to leveraging AI and ML technologies when it comes to improving their customer support strategy based on customer feedback evaluation. 


## Installation ##
In the repository you can find the **requirements.txt** file. Make sure that these are installed. 


## Usage ##


- To access the app, go to the **app.py** file. When you run the code, you will receive a http address that you can open in your preferred browser. (See C & D visualisations.) Paste a sample customer review in the text box as instructed. When you press the button to process the text, the software will return a result of either 'Positiveüëç' (meaning a positive rating) or a 'Negativeüëé' (meaning a negative rating) label.

- The file **Trans_DistilBERT_Sentiment_Model_for_Amazon_Personal_Care_Appliances.ipynb** is where the actual model was created. (See A & B visualisations.) The model is already trained and can be **found in the 'test' folder**. 


## Data Sources ##


- The **Tensorflow database** for the [Amazon US Personal Care Appliances data set](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/amazon_us_reviews) 
- **Research material on Natural Language Processing (NLP) models** and available libraries were sourced from the following:
  - [Amazon Product Review Sentiment Analysis Using BERT](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/amazon-product-review-sentiment-analysis-using-bert/https://github.com/yashinaniya/NLP_Projects/blob/main/Amazon_product_sentiment_analysis.ipynb)
